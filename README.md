# JavaScript Algorithm Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithm and data structure problems, solved in **JavaScript** and executed using **Node.js**. The problems cover a wide range of topics such as searching, sorting, dynamic programming, recursion, and more. It includes common interview problems and challenges from competitive programming platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **Codewars**.

## Repository Structure

Each file in the repository represents the solution to a specific problem. The structure of each file follows this format:

- **File name**: Indicates the type of problem or the name of the challenge.
- **Comments in the code**: Each solution includes explanatory comments on the logic and approach used.

Example structure:

```bash
/ ├── two-sum.js ├── binary-search.js └── dynamic-programming/knapsack.js
````

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Make sure to have Node.js installed on your machine to run the JavaScript files.

### Installing Node.js
You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## How to Run the Solutions

Each solution is a standalone JavaScript file that can be executed directly in the terminal using Node.js.

To run a specific solution, simply navigate to the directory where the file is located and use the following command:

```bash
node file-name.js
````
